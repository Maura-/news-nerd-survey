We want to learn more about our community of practice -- namely, teams that do news applications, editorial products, interactive graphics, CAR, data journalism, etc. How many are we? What kind of teams do we work on? What reporting structure do we follow and how do we organize our work? What works and what do we wish was different? How were we trained?

The plan is to edit the first survey down a bit and to send it out to via as many channels as we can and get as many people to take it as possible. We want to know how individual nerds see themselves, their roles in the universe, their challenges, and what they wish was different. We’ll present those findings at SRCCON. The second one below will be a bit harder -- it’s an attempt at a real census of nerds. Maybe we do this together with Pew, maybe we branch out on our own. I know OpenNews has been itching to do one of these and might have a little dough to pull it off. We’d send the second questionnaire later this year, after spending time perfecting it and learning some lessons from the first survey, to individual CTOs and editors at news organizations so we know we’re getting unduplicated results and can say something vaguely authoritative.

What we need from y’all is your unvarnished thoughts. What sucks? What and who are we missing? Is the first one too long? If so, what questions should we skip?
